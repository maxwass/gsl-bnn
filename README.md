## Setup

Refer to [Setting Up the Project Environment](docs/setup.md) for instructions on how to configure your local environment to run experiments.

### Directory Structure

- `experiments/`: Each experiment has its own directory here.
  - Contains a `README.md` file with execution details.
- `results/`: Corresponding results for each experiment are stored here.
  - This may include posterior parameters, cached data for faster reproducibility, etc.
