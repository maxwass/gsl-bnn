## Setup
- [Setting Up the Project Environment](docs/setup.md)
- Each experiment has its own directory in `experiments/` with a `README.md` file that describes how to run the experiment and a corresponding directory in `results/` to store the results (e.g. posterior parameters, cached data for faster reproducability, etc).
