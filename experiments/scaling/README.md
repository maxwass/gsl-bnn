To create the datasets using in these experiments, run the create_scaling_datasets.py file in this directory. This may take some time/memory as we generate large graphs.

All modeling/optimization done in notebook: scaling.ipynb.

results/scaling has a pkl file 'er_p25_dpg_size_gen_investigation_converg_iters.pkl' which caches some data from convergent DPG runs for easier replication/plotting in the notebook.
