On RG_{\frac{1}{3}} graphs and their analytic distance matrices, we perform 
- a prior predictive check, which eveluates the 'original prior' constructed with the independently interpretable parameter \theta, and results in an adjustment to the prior to create an 'altered prior', and
which results in adjustments made to the prior, and
- a posterior predictive check, to obtain a subjective measure of the quality of the model fit using the 'altered prior'.

All of this can be found in notebooks/predictive_checks.ipynb.
